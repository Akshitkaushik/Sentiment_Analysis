Hello Harish,

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to update you regarding the API access process. I connected with Harsh earlier, and he shared some steps for obtaining API access. Following those steps, the CHAD team created my API ID. As the next step, I shared this API ID with the OAuth team, requesting client credentials (client ID and client secret).

However, I was informed by a member of the OAuth team that, for DEV and QA environments, we now need to create the client ID and client secret ourselves. This is part of a new process where the OAuth team will only handle client credentials for PROD and UAT environments going forward.

As you know, Harsh built the API bot last year, but there have been significant changes to the API access steps since then. This is why I am requesting your help for the DEV database access.

If needed, I can schedule a meeting with you and Harsh to discuss this further and clarify the process.

Looking forward to your guidance.
