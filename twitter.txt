Umm you'll need help with.
Khan, Taufique 1 minute 12 seconds
So basically, Long story short, the state of Iowa wants to offer online enrollment to their three plans.
Khan, Taufique 1 minute 21 seconds
There be identified with a couple of indicators or event types will go through that, but really the gist of it is participants will enroll online with a plan.
Khan, Taufique 1 minute 35 seconds
Enrollment code will identify those participants with the population criteria below that, we can go through.
Khan, Taufique 1 minute 44 seconds
The report will get generated.
Khan, Taufique 1 minute 46 seconds
It'll go to RPA and then RPA will auto enroll or like a link a participant advisor to that participant record in a quipa or chpa.
Khan, Taufique 1 minute 59 seconds
One of those I've got it in the screens but and then once the advisor is attached to the participant and their own kind of chip equipped with screen, then the email notification will go out and we can go over that too.
But let me just show you where you needed help.
Khan, Taufique 2 minutes 18 seconds
So they'll get identified in this easy screen right here, and these two, these two types event types right here, IWEB or PWEB is what we're looking for.


Khan, Taufique
2 minutes 34 seconds2:34
Khan, Taufique 2 minutes 34 seconds
Umm, so any participant that enrolls the previous day will get identified with IWEB or PWEB.
Khan, Taufique 2 minutes 41 seconds
If that's the case, then we know that participant has enrolled the previous day online.
Khan, Taufique 2 minutes 48 seconds
Using the plan enrollment code, then the advisors that are the.
Khan, Taufique 2 minutes 56 seconds
So the CSM has agreed to keep a file of.
Khan, Taufique 3 minutes 2 seconds
Part advisors or commac codes in a shared drive that we can all access.
Khan, Taufique 3 minutes 8 seconds
So this is the link to the rotating advisors.
Khan, Taufique 5 minutes 58 seconds
They'll tie it to that participant and then really once the once that ADV subset or commac number is tied to the participant, then the email notification can go out to the participant in an email and an email is a required field when they enroll.
Khan, Taufique 6 minutes 22 seconds
So they should all have emails tied to them or listed in their record.
Khan, Taufique 6 minutes 28 seconds
Ohm.
Khan, Taufique 6 minutes 29 seconds
Let me see.
Khan, Taufique 6 minutes 31 seconds
And this is uh ashka.
Khan, Taufique 6 minutes 33 seconds
This is just a like the descriptions and the screenshots, it's just a I just gave you a description of how they're adding the Comex and the advisor currently.
Khan, Taufique 6 minutes 43 seconds
So it's just a step by step shows you the click path of how they're adding it now, and yeah, it does not really what you'll need for that, but it does show you how they do it manually, but again, you won't need that just because we'll have the the rotating advisor list and the chair drive for the bot, right?
Khan, Taufique 7 minutes 7 seconds
This last page, Akshit was kind of a a follow up from the business when we had our original intake they they had a few takeaways for us and we kind of had to like a 5 questions that we needed to get answered.
Khan, Taufique 7 minutes 24 seconds
There's three plan numbers for the state of Iowa.
Khan, Taufique 7 minutes 29 seconds
They were just asking if you know, if there's no emails provided or anything like that, but they're all required fields.
Khan, Taufique 7 minutes 37 seconds
Umm, audit logs for later two people get those right now.
Khan, Taufique 7 minutes 43 seconds
I guess that comes later, but yeah, that's uh, just this last page, just a couple of extra little criterias or the little extra requirements, but nothing too crazy.
