You are absolutely rightâ€”testing is typically done in three phases. As of now, we have completed testing using UAT data in the UAT environment.

The next step is to move the code to the production environment, where I will test the bot using some dummy production data. This will allow us to validate the bot's functionality before it starts processing real-time data. Additionally, we will verify all necessary production database access to ensure a smooth go-live process.

Please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions.
