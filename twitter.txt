I wanted to let you know that there is currently no input file in the directory, as you can see from the attached screenshot.

As discussed, we have scheduled the bot to run bi-weekly on Tuesdays. If we don't run it today, the next run will be on September 10th, since the old schedule has already been stopped.

Iâ€™m currently waiting for the input file and will keep you updated.

Thank you,
Akshit
