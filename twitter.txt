I wanted to inform you that last week, the business confirmed the estimated volume data size. I have attached the relevant email for your reference.

We are now ready for production testing, and I kindly request your approval to move the code into the production environment. For your convenience, I have attached the following approval emails:

UAT approval
Code review
Email template
Volume size estimate
Once approved, I will conduct a round of testing in production. If everything goes well, I will run the bot tomorrow and share the results with the business.

Thank you for your consideration, and please let me know if you have any questions.
