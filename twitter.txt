In the comp screen, as you confirmed before, when selecting the "commac" number in the "acct" column, the "Active Procedure" table below remains empty. Once we select the "commac," the same data is populated in the first row of the "Active Procedure" table.

As we discussed, and you confirmed, in real-time scenarios, the "acct" column contains values starting from the first row. It never happens that the first row is empty while data appears in the second, third, or fifth row. The values always start from the first row.
