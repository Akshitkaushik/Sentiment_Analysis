Hello Team,  

Thank you for joining.  

The bot, named **State Iowa Process**, has recently been automated. I have completed the testing, and since last week, we have been receiving live PPTs. I have triggered the bot with live PPTs, and it is working as expected.  

The goal of this bot is to offer **online enrollment** to State of Iowa employees. It generates a report identifying which PPTs enrolled online the previous day and then sends an email notification to those PPTs.  

### **Process Overview**  
This is a **linear and straightforward process**.  

- **POC**: Taufique (Business Analyst)  
- **Input File Source**: The input file is received via email from the **EBSI team**. The POC for this file is **Jyothilaxmi**, who shares it via email with a specific subject.  
- **Email Rule**: A rule is set to check emails with this subject, and the bot retrieves the file from the **Outlook folder**.  
- **Outlook Folder Name**: **State Iowa Process**  
- **File Naming Convention**: **Report_2299ddmmyyyy**  

### **Bot Handling Scenarios**  
The bot manages different scenarios as follows:  

1. **If the input file is not received** â†’ The bot sends an email notification to the business team.  
2. **If the input file is empty** â†’ The bot notifies the business team with an "Audit Input File" email.  
3. **If the bot encounters an error** â†’ It notifies our team only, attaching the system and error logs.  
4. **If the bot runs successfully** â†’ It sends an email to both the business team and our team, attaching the audit file.  

### **Bot Automation Steps**  
1. Check if the input file exists in the designated Outlook folder.  
   - If found, download and save it in the input folder.  
   - If not, send an email notification.  
2. After downloading, check the number of rows in the file.  
3. Create status folders.  
4. Validate the required column values:  
   - If mandatory values are missing, skip that record, update the status as **"Missing Mandatory Value"**, and notify the business team with the audit file.  
5. Log in to the **Easy Application**.  
6. Select the database.  
7. Enter the **screen name** (CHAP).  
8. Enter the **SSN** and **GAID**.  
9. Check for any pop-ups.  
10. Click the **COMP** button and wait for the **COMP** screen.  
11. Select the **COMM ACCT** number in the **COMM ACCT Table**.  
12. Check if the required table values are selected.  
    - If selected, confirm the pop-up.  
13. Press **F6**, check for pop-ups, and press **F6** again.  
14. Extract the final status:  
    - If the final status is **"Participant Changes"**, the bot sends a **Welcome Email** to the user and updates the status as **"COMM ACCT Successfully Updated"**.  
15. Proceed to the next record.  
16. After processing all records:  
    - Share the audit file.  
    - Remove the input file from the input folder.
