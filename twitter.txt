Subject: Pausing Development of Current Project

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As per our recent discussion, I will be pausing the development of my current project until I receive further updates from you. I understand that you are coordinating with the EBSI team regarding the data aspects of the project.

Once you have the necessary information and are able to provide an update, I will promptly resume development as required. Please let me know if there are any additional steps I should take in the meantime or if there is any other information you need from my side.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your update.

Best regards,

Akshit Kaushik
