Dear Khan,

I hope this email finds you well.

As per our recent discussion on the call, I have been reviewing the "Commanc find" step with my team.

You mentioned that, in real-time scenarios, the ACCT column always contains a value and is never left blank. Could you please confirm this for me?
Additionally, as advised, I will be pausing the development of my current project until I receive further updates from you. I understand that you are coordinating with the EBSI team regarding the data part, and once you have the necessary information, I will resume development as required.

Currently, as you mentioned, I am working with my team to verify if the "Commanc find" step can be executed via a query. You mentioned that the team is manually searching for the Commanc line by line, so I will check if it can be optimized using a query and update you accordingly.

Thank you for your guidance and support.

Best regards,
Akshit Kaushik
