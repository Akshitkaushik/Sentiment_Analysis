As Nitin mentioned, he has verified the “Send” folder and was unable to find any emails related to the "canteytech.com" domain in the Outlook folder and the Proofpoint application. I have also re-verified the Outlook, Proofpoint application, and input files, but couldn't locate any emails associated with this domain.

For your reference, I have attached some screenshots from Outlook and Proofpoint related to the record 758240-01. Additionally, I have attached a screenshot from the bot run yesterday, where you can see all the recipients.

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thank you!

Best regards,
