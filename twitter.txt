I hope you're doing well.

Today, we successfully deployed the latest code. Could you please confirm the schedule date? As per the email below, we need to run this bot biweekly starting now. Just to confirm, the next biweekly run is scheduled for Tuesday, September 10th, correct? So, moving forward, we will run the bot every other Tuesday.

For your reference, before this deployment, the bot was running every Wednesday.

Please confirm this so we can finalize the bot's schedule.


The bot has been successfully deployed with the new changes. I have attached the change request file to this email. The changes in this latest code include:

Removal of the Cirrus part
Update to the email
