Hi Harish,

I’ve completed the first round of testing on the production data. The bot is functioning as expected, and I manually validated the data within the Easy application. The bot successfully selects the correct CommAC number based on the business file provided.

Today's testing was conducted using my email to receive both the audit file and communication email. Tomorrow, I will run the bot again, and the communication email and audit file will be sent to the business team as per the process.

Thank you for your guidance and support. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to verify in the next test run.
