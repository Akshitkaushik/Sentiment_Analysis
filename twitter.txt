**Subject:** Request for Approval and Assistance with Database Access for DEV and QA Environments  

Dear Harish,  

I hope this email finds you well.  

I need your assistance regarding database access for the DEV and QA environments. My API ID has been created, and I raised an OAuth client setup request for the bot ID for all environments (DEV, QA, UAT, and PROD). However, I was informed by Gourav Gupta from the API team that for DEV and QA, we need to create the client ID and client secret ourselves.  

While attempting to create these, I realized that database access is required to proceed. Unfortunately, I currently do not have access to the database.  

I referred to the database access steps on the Confluence page and found that we can raise a request for database access for the DEV and QA environments via an IT service ticket. I have attached the relevant screenshots and the link to the steps for your reference.  

Here are my requests:  

1. **Approval for Database Access:** I kindly request your approval to proceed with requesting database access for the DEV and QA environments.  
2. **Manager Assistance to Raise Request:** According to the IT service process, only a manager can raise the request for database access. Therefore, I request your help in raising this access request on my behalf.  

Additionally, the business team has informed me that all databases are being used for the MTR bot.  

I have included all the required information for the database access request below for your reference.  

Thank you for your support and guidance. Please let me know if you need any additional details from my side.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
