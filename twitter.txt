Hello Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I have received approval from Harish and the business team to push the new code into production. Kindly proceed with importing the attached ZIP files into the production environment.

Bot Name: Termination Date

I have attached two ZIP files:

One ZIP file contains the supporting images.
The other ZIP file contains the code.
Please import both files into production. Let me know if you require any additional information or assistance.

Thank you for your support!
