State of Iowa – Online Enrollment Bot - Requirements
EBSI Job #: 2229

Goal: 
Offer online enrollment to the State of Iowa state employees; generate a report identifying which ppts have enrolled online the previous day. Then, send an email notification to those ppts.

Current Process Description: 
All enrollments for the State of Iowa are done with a paper form. 
New hire receives the form via the advisor or state web site, completes the form, then submits to Empower to process. Empower is not the deferral record keeper. This is all done by the Money-In Team using EASY forms. 
The State of Iowa requires an advisor to be assigned to each new enrollment. If the new hire is meeting with an advisor while they complete the paper enrollment form, the advisor will add their information to the form. If the new hire is not meeting with an advisor, the Money-In team will add the “default” advisor listed in the Comp Screen in EASY to the new hire’s account during the processing steps. Participant can change advisor at any time by completing a paper form and sending it to Empower. 
Current online functionality does not allow participants to elect a specific advisor via the current process. 

Future Process Description: 
Proposed Online Enrollment process: 
•	New participant uses Plan Enrollment Code (PEC) to enroll
o	During enrollment, advisor section will be assigned an ADV XXXX versus a specific advisor name through the Comp Screen in EASY which feeds to the Subset Screen
•	Participant will elect deferral through employer portal – Empower is not the deferral recordkeeper for the State of Iowa
•	BOT process
o	Assign the current default advisor to the participant account post enrollment from the Comp Screen in EASY; default advisors rotate quarterly, CSM process
o	Send email notification to participant re: State of Iowa.ppt communication.post enrollment_final file_0403.pdf
o	Criteria for report 
	Enrolled online via PEC
	Participant subset is ADV XXXX
	Participant name, email address, mailing address
There will be an email notification to the participant to notify them of the advisor assigned to their account. The participant can change the advisor at any time via paper form.

Takeaways from our first intake call:

1.	What are ALL the plan numbers for the State of Iowa?

4.	Frequency: what time of day would you like ppts to receive the email communication?
Shannon’s response:  My suggestion is any time before noon eastern.

5.	Should EBSI and RPA do a historical cleanup to identify if any ppts are not tied to an advisor?
a.	If no, we can disregard this takeaway.
b.	If yes, should they use the current list of ADVs/COMMACs that Kurt provided us? 
Danette response- Yes, I think a clean up would be good. Kurt/Shannon- thoughts?
Shannon’s response:  I think that is a good idea as well.  Yes, use the list Kurt provided to you.
