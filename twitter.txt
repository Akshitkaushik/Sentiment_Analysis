I just wanted to check with you regarding the HDQ bot. Today, we received the input file, and across both sheets, we have a total of over 10,000 emails to send. However, since the bot is only capable of sending up to 10,000 emails in a single day, I wanted to confirm if it would be acceptable to process one sheet's data today and the other sheet's data tomorrow.

The sheet names are:

Eligibility
Vesting
