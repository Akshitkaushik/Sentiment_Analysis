Hello Taufique,

As we are approaching the MTR bot deployment, I have a few questions and would appreciate your help:

What volume can we expect at the time of go-live?
On which day and at what time should we run this bot? Please share the schedule.
Will this bot be a scheduled bot or a trigger-based bot?
Looking forward to your response.
