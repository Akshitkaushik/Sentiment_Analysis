As discussed during our last call, we are using the provided endpoint along with my clientâ€™s credentials to generate the token. While we are successfully able to generate the token, we are encountering an "Invalid Authorization Token" error when passing the token.

Could you please assist us in resolving this issue? Alternatively, if there is another way to verify the token, we would appreciate your guidance.

Looking forward to your response
