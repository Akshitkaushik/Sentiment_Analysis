Hereâ€™s the updated version with "command number" replaced by "COMMAC":

Hi Anand and Vikram,

The business user has a question, and I need your assistance to check and update me. On the GQ19SSCP screen, we have an "Acct" column with multiple records in the first column. Currently, to search for a specific COMMAC, I am going through the records line by line.

Is there an alternative way to search for that specific COMMAC using a query or keystroke, instead of going through the lines manually? I have attached a screenshot for your reference. Please let me know if there is any other method to search directly for the particular COMMAC.

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
