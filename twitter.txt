I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to provide you with an update on the ongoing tasks related to the RPA implementation. During our recent walkthrough call, Khan provided an overview of the RPA activities. Specifically, we are focused on updating the Comm/Acct number on the CHPA screen. In line with Khan's requirements, I have already prepared the solution document, which he has reviewed and approved. I've attached the approval email for your reference.

There is one item still pending. We are currently utilizing an additional Comm/Acct file, and Khan is verifying with the EBSI team if they can directly incorporate this file into their workflow. If they can, it would allow us to exclude this file from the RPA process. I am awaiting an update on this matter. You may refer to the attached email for more details on the discussion.

Once all details are finalized and the EBSI file is fully prepared, I will arrange a call with Khan to go over the solution once more.

Regarding the timeline, I will confirm the dates as soon as I receive the final requirements.

Lastly, could you please advise whether I should coordinate the call setup with Khan or the EBSI team?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional information.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
