Dear Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to clarify the timing of the original email. It was received by you on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at 5:49 PM EST. The sample email we shared shows it was sent at 3:18 AM on September 11, 2024, IST. This difference in time is because India is 9 hours and 30 minutes ahead of Eastern Standard Time (EST).

In summary, the email sample is in IST, while the time you received is in EST. I hope this helps clear up any confusion.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
