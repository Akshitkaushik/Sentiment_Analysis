Hi @D R, jyothilakshmi@Hlavaty, Nancy and all,

I spoke to Automation and my team after our call. We have a much better recommendation that Danette and Shannon just signed off on:

We are going to turn on Online Enrollment for the 457 plan (744906-01) with a Plan Enrollment Code (PEC) and add a “dummy ppt” account to make sure the Event Type: NPDI ENRL is pulling in. Rather than using the UAT environment, having a “live” record for our Automation Teams is the best route to take.

@D R, jyothilakshmi, once we have the dummy account, you should be able to run the population criteria as is and pull in the record.

More to come in the next couple days. I will keep everyone updated as we move forward.

Thank you,
