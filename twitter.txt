Pradeep, can you please share another SSN number with me? I already used this SSN with a different COMMAC. The issue is that when I search for COMMAC A00021 using this SSN, the bot takes too much time to complete the transaction. The bot checks the COMMAC line by line, and it takes a lot of time because, for this SSN, we have around 100 COMMAC entries in the table. Can you please provide a different SSN? Also, I used this SSN today, so we cannot reuse it because each SSN can only be used once per day
