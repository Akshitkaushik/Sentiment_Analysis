Hello Rob,

I wanted to inform you that we are currently receiving the input files in the S3 location at [ ].

Since we will now be receiving input files for three different databases, I have created separate subfolders in the S3 location based on the database names. We would like each file to be placed inside its respective subfolder according to the database name.

For example:

If the folder name is in02, it should contain only the in02 database file.
If the file belongs to in03, it should be inside the in03 subfolder.
Similarly, the is02 file should be placed inside the is02 subfolder.
I am attaching a screenshot of the subfolder structure for your reference, along with the main S3 location path.

Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
