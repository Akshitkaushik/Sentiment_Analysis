Hi Jyothi,

As we discussed during the last code review call, Cheryl has given her approval. You can check the approval in the email chain below. Please provide your approval as well, as I need to update the code into production by tomorrow.


Hi Harish,

Please give me your approval to push the code into production. Jyothi and Cheryl have already given their approval, so I just need yours to proceed.


Please give me your approval for this email template. I used the email PDF you shared last time to create this template. If everything looks good, please give me your approval so I can attach this template to the RPA code
