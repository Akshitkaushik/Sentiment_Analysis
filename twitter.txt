We will use these client credentials for generating the JWT token, with the username and password specified in the JWT endpoints.

Client username: userid in the JWT endpoints
Client secret: password in the JWT endpoints
These client credentials have been created by us and will only be used for the development and QA environments. The client credentials for production and UAT will be shared via the API OAuth at a later time."




JWT endpoints have been shared by Tom.

Updated API endpoints for each environment have also been shared by Tom.

As an example and reference, we are using this API endpoint from one of our projects. This project also uses JWT tokens, and we can check the endpoint format there.
