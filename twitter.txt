Just wanted to give you a quick update. During our last call, Khan explained what we're doing with RPA, mainly updating the Comm/Acct number on the CHPA screen. I’ve created the solution document based on his requirements, and he has approved it. I’ve attached the approval email for your reference.

One thing is still pending: Khan is checking with the EBSI team if they can use another Comm/Acct file directly in their process. If they can, we can skip that file in our RPA setup. I’m just waiting for an update on this. You can check the attached email for more details.

Once everything is sorted and the EBSI file is ready, I’ll set up a call with Khan to go over the solution again.

I’ll confirm the dates as soon as I have the final requirements. Also, could you let me know if I should set up the call with Khan or the EBSI team?
