Thank you for the current termination report.

I hope you remember that during our discussion on Monday, you mentioned you would share some updates to the URL descriptions. Previously, you shared two URL descriptions, but I would appreciate it if you could share the rest as well. For example:

Morning (3.21) Key
Morning (3.w22) Key Description
Kindly provide the remaining URL descriptions at your earliest convenience.
Regarding the termination report, I noticed the changes you shared. However, during our discussion last Monday, you informed me that the number [321] also needs to be added to the termination template. Could you please clarify exactly where this number should be included? This will help me ensure the report is updated accurately.

For your reference, I have attached all the URL descriptions. Kindly review and share the updated URL description changes.

Looking forward to your response.
