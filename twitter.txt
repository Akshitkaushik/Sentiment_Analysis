Hello Khan,

I hope you are doing well.

I am reaching out to request your assistance with some information regarding the input file processing in the production environment. Could you please confirm the following details:

Could you confirm the daily record count or volume we will receive in the input file for the production environment?

Upon receiving the input file, what is the expected timeframe for the bot to complete the task?
Thank you very much for your help and support. Your insights will greatly assist us in preparing for the production deployment.
