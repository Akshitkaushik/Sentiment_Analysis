I have already shared the headers, URL, and body parameters in the previous email. For your reference, I have now attached a screenshot along with the headers again. This screenshot demonstrates the scenario with JWT + headers.

However, when we use Bearer + token, I encounter the issue mentioned. I have also attached a screenshot of the Bearer error. Additionally, I shared some approaches in the team chatâ€”please review them to see if any of those might work. If they seem feasible, we can proceed with those approaches to verify the token.
