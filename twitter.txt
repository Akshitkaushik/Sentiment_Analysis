Yes, both bots are performing the same job. I confirmed with my team that the second bot has not been triggered yet. As discussed yesterday, the bot changes related to the termination dates have been completed.

Could you please share the latest test cases with me? I will complete the final round of testing and share the results with you for your feedback.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Akshit
