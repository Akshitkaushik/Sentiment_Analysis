I reviewed the shared Excel file, and it currently contains only one record. Could you please add more records, including both positive and negative cases, so I can handle all scenarios and train the bot effectively during the development stage?

Secondly, I noticed that the SSN extension column is missing. This is a mandatory field for querying the participant and accessing the correct account, as participants can have multiple group accounts and extensions. Please ensure this column is added.

Lastly, regarding the email-sending action, I understand that the bot is supposed to send an email after completing the easy transaction step. However, in cases where the bot cannot complete the action (e.g., due to restrictions in the participant's account), should the bot still send an email to the user, or should it skip this step since the action was unsuccessful?
