Yes, you are correct that the four records are not in the Easy MA Enrollment database. I added these records for testing purposes to understand how we can handle incorrect data if received in real-time.

The 4th failure comment â€“ "Mandatory data missing" means that if any mandatory column value is empty in real-time, we will skip that record and update the comment accordingly. In the attached screenshot, you can see that the database is empty for a mandatory value, which is why I included such data for testing.

I have tested with the development data. Could you please help me by sharing the UAT test data so that I can proceed with UAT testing? Also, if you have any records where multiple GAID values exist, please share those as well so I can test that scenario.

Thank you for your support!

Best regards,
