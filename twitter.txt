Subject: Query Regarding Production Testing for Demo SSNs

Hello Khan,

Today, I conducted the production testing manually using the three demo SSNs (123, 222, 333) that you shared. I have a query regarding the "Acct" column on the comp page. As per your confirmation, each "CommAc" entry should start in the first row of the "Acct" column. However, for these three demo SSNs, the "CommAc" field appears to be empty. Iâ€™ve attached a screenshot for your reference.

If I proceed to run the bot with this data, it will execute without any issues and will share the output with you as expected. However, since "CommAc" is empty or not found, could you please look into this issue and update me accordingly?

Additionally, could you provide the email addresses within the input file for these three demo SSNs? An email address is mandatory for each SSN.

Thank you for your assistance.
