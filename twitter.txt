Thank you for the input data. I checked the provided SSN number in the Easy application, but I am not getting the same GAID and SSN extension as mentioned in the input sheet. On the attached screenshot of the Easy application, you can clearly see that the SSN column is empty, and the GAID is also different, but in the input sheet, we have the SSN number. I have attached the screenshot; please check as the data seems to be mismatched
