I hope this message finds you well. I just wanted to follow up to check if you had a chance to review the updated URL and template output that I shared. I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your feedback at your earliest convenience.

Additionally, I wanted to inform you about the upcoming code freeze period, which will begin on December 19th and end on January 14th. During this time, no changes will be possible in the production environment.
