**Subject:** Follow-Up on MTR Walkthrough Call  

Dear Khan,  

Thank you for the insightful MTR walkthrough call earlier. I truly appreciate your time and effort in explaining the details.  

I have a few questions and requests for further clarification:  

1. Could you kindly share the DEV and UAT POST URLs? I will need them to raise the Bot ID request.  
2. Regarding the HTTP POST body, could you please confirm the values for the following fields:  
   - **Reason**  
   - **InitiatedID**  
   - **InitiatedType**  
   Specifically, for each record, do we need to update these values with the same identifiers, such as "GP00" and "Batch"? Please clarify what values need to be assigned for each record.  
3. Regarding quality control (QC), how can we confirm that the bot is performing the tasks accurately? I’d appreciate your thoughts on this.  
4. Could you let me know the volume of data we should expect to receive in production?  
5. For every record, is it mandatory to create a JWT token?  
6. Lastly, could you share the email address of the business team that will receive the audit logs in the future?  

Thank you in advance for your guidance and support. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Akshit
