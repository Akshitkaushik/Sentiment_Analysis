"Jyothi, could you please review my email to Harrison below? I’ve already mentioned that the decision regarding ADV validation is up to the business team, not me. If they are satisfied with today's demo, I have no concerns. Recently, Khan informed me that they require this validation, which is why I requested that the data be included in the input file. However, if their team is fine without the ADV validation, I have no objections; it’s their decision. That’s why we set up a call with the team today.
