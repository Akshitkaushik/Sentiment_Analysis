Subject: Request to Create Two Bot Runners for Talcott DMF Bot

Hi Sanjay,

I need your help in creating two bot runners for the Talcott DMF bot.

Recently, I received an enhancement request for the bot, where they want to include two additional databases in the current flow. I have two bot IDs, each with specific database access.

Additional Information:

Bot ID: [Provide Bot ID]

Password: [Provide Password]
Database: [Provide Database]
Bot ID: [Provide Bot ID]

Password: [Provide Password]
Database: [Provide Database]
Since we are already running this bot with an existing bot ID, please use it as a mirror ID and ensure these two bot runners have all the required access.

Kartghiga, if anything is missing, please share the details with Sanjay.

Let me know if you need any further information.
