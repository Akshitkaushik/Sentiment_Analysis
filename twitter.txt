Hi Team,

I hope you're doing well.

I need your assistance in updating the HDQ bot schedule. The business team has requested a change in the current schedule. Currently, the bot is running every Wednesday, but they would like it to be scheduled every other Tuesday, on a bi-weekly basis.

Please update the bot schedule accordingly, as business and Harish have already confirmed the change. You can refer to the email below for confirmation.

Additionally, I shared the latest code with Nithin today, and he has successfully deployed it into production. We need to run the bot today once the new ESBSI input file is uploaded by the team. I will notify you as soon as the input file is ready so we can proceed with today's run.

Please also ensure that the current Wednesday schedule is stopped.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Akshit
