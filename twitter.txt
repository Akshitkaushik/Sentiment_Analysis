June 13, 2024, 5:05PM
22m 32s

Presley, Rob   0:03
Pilot no generation. Yay.
No generation. Yay.
Alright, you're around.
Alright, you're around.
Jody, what can you and and?
Jody, what can you and and?

Yancey, Jody   0:11
Alright, so I'll just, I'll just do high level.
All right.
So I'll just, I'll just do high level.
I'm sorry, Rob, go ahead.
I'm sorry, rob. Good.

Presley, Rob   0:14
Sure.
Sure.
And ohh no, just one thing like Harrison.
And ohh no, just one thing like Harrison.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know if I I didn't look through the invite to see if you had a specific agenda or if you just want to walk through the process.
I don't know if I I didn't look through the invite to see if you had a specific agenda.

Mulvihill, Harrison stopped transcription

Presley, Rob   0:22
So we can get a better understanding of things.

Mulvihill, Harrison   0:24
It's exactly that, right?
It's it's, uh, walk through the process specifically with the both of you on just to have a little bit more context about what the current American funds bot does and everything there.

Presley, Rob   0:25
OK.

Mulvihill, Harrison   0:35
As you mentioned, it's about 90% of the same and we just want to make sure that I had the the right people on to know what this is.

Presley, Rob   0:35
OK.

Mulvihill, Harrison   0:41
The what?
What this is actually talking about?

Presley, Rob   0:45
Cool. OK.

Yancey, Jody   0:46
Yeah.
So current process they open an Sr, they send us a spreadsheet that looks like this.
You can see it's got plan ID, name, that recovery ID type and the amount to be credited.
I take this sheet that they send and I change it into a sheet that the I guess it would be called the.
It's not even a bot, it's like a DBC that is done on this.

Presley, Rob   1:13
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   1:14
Shoot.
Sorry, I don't know where it went.
I thought I had.
Uh, myself here, so I turned it into a very specific format that the DBC can handle.
So I strip out the header, I strip out everything and I give it just a plan number.
I change the type to the actual recovery, so there's two recoveries.
There's one that ends in a C and one that ends in an R so I take what they've put there.
It says like prorated to participants and then prorated to forfeiture, let's say, and I know prorated to participants equals this structure and then parade to FORFEITURE equals the one within R so then I replace that with that, and I make these these amounts.
These are all positive, even though it knows some are negative, some positive.
I just make that into a general.
I save that as a CSV file.
Then I actually I.
Then I put that into this directory out here is there.
We actually have a CAFR directory in the inst.
Shared driver.
I don't even know what this is, but I just put it out here and in there call it whatever month I'm running it dossie it dot CSV, then I go back to easy and actually go into the screen called CAFR which is create American funds recoveries.

Presley, Rob   2:20
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   2:26
I type in the file name that you know March dot CSV.
I tell it when's my begin date?
I usually just make at the beginning of the month whatever.
Give it the end date and then give it the sketch date.
This begin to end.
Then sketch date.
That's the assessment row that I wanted to run for, so I would probably do like I'm about to give this file here this month.
So I would do like 15 June, you know, 25 June running on 26 June something like that.
So I plugged it in there, I hit F6, it goes out there and does.
This is where I don't know what it does, but it does.
Whatever it does, it takes that spreadsheet with this data here and then inputs that information onto these plans.
Once that's done umm I get.
Ohh sorry, so if it if there's any problems or anything at all I get a email saying unsuccessful and then I get this log file and at the very bottom it would tell me line 512 has has an error or something to that effect.
I go in and I fix that plan or I fix that error and I have to rerun the whole process.
This is kind of an all or nothing process.
If one error happens, it stops it and does nothing.
So once I get the actual complete or success log, I go here and I make sure OK I had 3415 on the original sheet and inserted 3415.
I know that it completed and it's done at that point I have to do one other thing and that's take.
So when they built this 15 years ago or something like that, the payee screen didn't need ARS names.
So I have to take this report.
You can see there's 57 items where created structures for me.
That means that there's 57 items that are missing in ARS name, so I turn this into an Excel spreadsheet I filter on reconstruct created for AF ORCR, and then I I go into those plans and I manually add the ARS name.
Once I do that, I run another report called GAR and that just is for me to double check.
Did I miss any you know since I did these manual that I missed setting up the ARS name on any plans, so I do a filter on that Find plans that are AF real OCR and give me the errors names if there's any blanks then I fix them there.
So that's basically the long and short of it.
Technically this takes me about you in hour 2 hours depending on how many errors come through.
Hopefully recently I haven't been a whole lot of errors, so it it's really not that difficult.
But again, the problem is I'm the one that has to run this whenever anyone else's tried to run this, they get blocked.
They get, you know, cannot security this, that whatever.
You know, they get different kind of errors out there.
So the turn around time on this is pretty short.
They send it around mid to late.
The last month of the quarter and they want it run before the end of that quarter.
So that's why if we, you know I have somebody try to run it and they come into a problem, I don't have time to go to systems and be like what's the problem?
I just tell them I'll do it because we don't have time to be trying to troubleshoot what the heck happened, so that's really unfortunately high level.
Of what?

Presley, Rob   5:40
OK.

Yancey, Jody   5:40
Of what?
The process does today.
Again, I don't know what CAFR does.
Once I hit submit but it inserts the structure, it finds its plan and inserts the amounts it creates the structures if it's needed.
If the structure is already there, kind of like the American funds bot, it finds it's already there and it just puts the assessment row it has to do some kind of check to say do I need this structure or do I not need this structure?
So that was that was fast.
But that's that's what.
That's what this does.

Presley, Rob   6:06
So is this.
Is this what you're going through?
Is is this feels like a dumb question, but is this like the DBC process?

Yancey, Jody   6:12
I believe it's a DBC process.

Presley, Rob   6:14
OK.
So.

Yancey, Jody   6:16
For that, I don't think about that this thing takes once I hit submit, it takes about 30 seconds to return a success or failure email for 3000 plans.

Presley, Rob   6:25
Wow, OK.
OK, there's and if you needed to go in and add a record based on the input file that's provided.
If you needed to go in there and and click through the manual process, is that something you've done in the past?

Yancey, Jody   6:42
Yeah.
So if for what?
So let let's for example like this guy right here.

Presley, Rob   6:47
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   6:47
So you can see this is on here.
This would be 1 where I would go into it.
It would have loaded this structure.
It would have loaded this amount, but it found more than one UPA.
So I have to actually go into that structure to this plan, go into the UPA setup and choose what fund to pick.
So what does everything except for pick that fund, it just kicks back saying I didn't complete the payee setup because there was more than one fund.
I don't know if going into the plan would actually be helpful to kind of show you what I'm talking about here.

Presley, Rob   7:19
Well, and what I'm thinking is so So what you've just gone through is is essentially your.
Uh.
Process for for for initiating the DBC based on the input file that you've got.

Yancey, Jody   7:29
Right, right.
Yeah, yeah.

Presley, Rob   7:30
Yeah.
And and and I'm wondering.
I'm from a bot perspective this this is this.
This is like a.
This is kind of unique, I maybe this is where the permissions lie somehow.
Maybe there's permissions associated with the DBC I I I I don't know.
I'm gonna make an that up, to be honest, but from a bot perspective, we would take the input file and then navigate through each of the individual screens that require the input and then just, you know insert go through, click OK on a pop up or whatever is required for the step, and if there is a record that has a UPA already set up.

Yancey, Jody   7:53
Umm.

Presley, Rob   8:08
Obviously the messaging would pop up in easy and we would need to know like what to do instead.
So you mentioned like you'd have to go in and do this.

Yancey, Jody   8:14
Yeah.

Presley, Rob   8:16
That so that that to me seems like the process that we would look to to to replicate as opposed to an initiating the DBC.
My initial reaction?

Yancey, Jody   8:29
And I I I agree with you, Rob.
I think they want to get away from the Matt.
Matt's on.
I think they wanna get away from this DBC.

Presley, Rob   8:34
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   8:35
They want the bot to do to do their stuff that we we don't want to run CAFR anymore.
The problem with this CAFR is I'm the one that can initiate it.
They they wanna get away.

Presley, Rob   8:45
Yep.

Yancey, Jody   8:46
Away from that and they want anyone to be able to say, hey, load, hey, Rob, load this file for me and then you know you do the work if if I'm not here.
So I would agree that's I think that's what they're looking for.

Presley, Rob   8:57
OK, OK, I understand.
Do do you have kind of on the spot yet?
All your documents teared up, which I totally appreciate by the way.
But umm, do you have, I guess two questions.
Do you have documentation on what the manual process would be to to walk through the records individually and and handle things on a manual basis?
If you if if you're out of the office, for example.

Yancey, Jody   9:20
Umm.
I I don't because we've never run into that before it would.

Presley, Rob   9:25
OK.

Yancey, Jody   9:25
It would simply be if I'm out of the office and I can't get this run.
Take that, take that spreadsheet that I created and go in there into each plan and manually go through the steps like you know is the structure there.

Presley, Rob   9:32
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   9:38
Yes, it is.
Now I've got a, you know, go through it.
I've got to put the amounts in there.
I've got to do this.
I've got to set up these rows so it would be.
Kind of like the the first American funds bot where I walk through and I said I get this today.

Presley, Rob   9:50
Yep.

Yancey, Jody   9:52
Right.
There is no bot right now.

Presley, Rob   9:54
Yep.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

Yancey, Jody   10:05
As adding this manually.

Presley, Rob   10:06
And and candidly, Jody, unfortunately, I think that that that's what we need.
We need to have.

Yancey, Jody   10:11
OK. Yeah.

Presley, Rob   10:11
Yeah, the steps that the the navigation steps, the click path through, umm.
And then if there's a, you know, I call him an edge case.
That sounds like it happens with some degree of regularity, but a case that has the UPA already set up or or another.

Yancey, Jody   10:22
Yep, Yep.

Presley, Rob   10:25
Another oddity.
Umm, those are the things we would look to to incorporate into the code.

Yancey, Jody   10:31
And that's that's the same issue we had with the first bot was stuff happens that I don't even know about or can plan for.
It'll happen once the bot runs the first time.
We say Ohh didn't even know that existed.
Right here's.

Presley, Rob   10:45
Wait, yeah.

Yancey, Jody   10:45
Here's how we're going to fix that going forward, yeah.

Presley, Rob   10:48
Umm.
And I think like you know the I wanna say like the 2nd or the 3rd iteration we had a pretty well in hand with those.

Yancey, Jody   10:54
Yeah, we nailed down.

Presley, Rob   10:55
The yeah.

Yancey, Jody   10:55
Yep, Yep, Yep.

Presley, Rob   10:56
Yeah.
So that's that's I think that's the process we would look to to, to replicate and then I think it the same and the same breath I would, I would have dictate using your credentials we would mirror your credentials for the bot ID so that there wouldn't be any entitlements variances that would take us out of CAFR I believe and get us into screens that we already know we have access to. Yeah.

Yancey, Jody   11:22
Yeah.
Yeah, because there should be absolutely no restrictions.
If you're going right into easy, like anyone can go in and punch these in, it's just ******* where it becomes hitting the submit.

Presley, Rob   11:29
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   11:34
If you will and CAFR is where we have the problem.
So if we remove ourselves from CAFR.
Yeah, anyone can, you know, go in here and do this.
I I would agree.

Presley, Rob   11:43
OK.
OK.
You you mentioned the the type.

Anand, Vikram   11:46
No.

Presley, Rob   11:48
Sorry, Vikram. Good.

Anand, Vikram   11:49
Started on uh, I can wait.
Drop.
But I do have a question.

Presley, Rob   11:53
OK.

Anand, Vikram   11:54
I'll.
I'll wait for you both to finish.

Presley, Rob   11:56
Sure, sure.
I just.
I was just gonna say there's a tight turn around time frame and it's OK and is is is umm.

Yancey, Jody   12:00
Yes, yes.
Yeah.
So on the other American funds bot, we kind of said that, you know, we've got some time, just one, they always, always always have said this needs to be deposited into these accounts before the end of the month.
And unfortunately, they they send this file 15 days before the end of the month and it takes, you know, a day or two to get it going.

Presley, Rob   12:15
OK.

Yancey, Jody   12:24
Thank gosh CAFR takes, you know, like I said, 30 seconds to a minute to run and it takes me an hour to clean it up.
But so I've never had a problem with the turn around, but I know our bot for the American funds took like a week or two.
I don't know if it's gotten faster, but I remember the first run was quite a while it took it quite a while.

Presley, Rob   12:39
Yeah.
Yeah, that was the first run and then we had, there's a couple of handoffs that are associated with it, but so we've allocated 2 bot runners and I think they'll quote me on this, but the last I think each subsequent run, once we allocated the two runners completed within, might have been a make two, maybe three days.

Yancey, Jody   13:00
OK, OK.

Presley, Rob   13:00
Umm. Yeah.
And then there's some clean up that, that and I forgotten.

Yancey, Jody   13:04
Yeah, there's a.
Yeah, yeah.

Presley, Rob   13:05
Yeah, I forgotten.
Who?
What his name is, but there's another person on the team that does some clean up and then they need to, you know.
Then they hand off over to Brad Benfer and the American funds team.
So a couple couple little gaps in there, but the bot on the on the F side finishes now within 2-3 days at most come.

Yancey, Jody   13:21
OK.
OK, that's not bad because I'll be honest with you when I get this, I schedule it out a couple days because I've gotten this before.
Ran it and they'll come back and say, oh, we sent to the wrong file or.
Ohh, we want to do this that the other I'm like.
So now I get it.

Presley, Rob   13:36
Yeah.

Yancey, Jody   13:38
Second, I get it, I get it all keyed up, if you will.
And then I skip.

Presley, Rob   13:41
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   13:42
So again, I got that scheduled date.
I push that schedule date for like 3 days to give to just to give me some time, but again there's some we can talk about future future state.

Presley, Rob   13:51
OK. Yeah.

Yancey, Jody   13:52
But yeah, there is a I I do wanna just say there is a short turn around time on this.
They they definitely say this has to be done before the end of the end of the month.

Presley, Rob   14:00
Gotcha.
And I think like just based on the number of records that you showed, obviously we have to back out the processing duration.
What easy screens are associated with it and determine how long it takes to process one record?
You know, if that's five minutes and there's, you know, 4000 records on a quarterly basis, we can just kind of back out the math and see what that looks like.

Yancey, Jody   14:13
Umm.

Presley, Rob   14:17
So it might take a couple of days.
We might.
We might allocate 2 runners to do it.
I think we we definitely have some flexibility from that perspective.
We would want to schedule it though, so if you know if the expectation for example is the Sr is created by the 15th of the month and that file is deposited there.

Yancey, Jody   14:37
Yeah.
So.
So there's there's there's another issue.
Sometimes they get it to us at so they never get it to us.
At the same time, and they will, there are months where they come and say American funds and needs an extra two to three days.

Meyer, Matt   14:51
So yeah, I I think we addressed that, Jody.

Yancey, Jody   14:52
So there's not a there's not a drop dead date that they get it to us here.

Presley, Rob   14:55
OK.

Meyer, Matt   14:56
I I think we'll go to the American funds team and say we gotta have a hard deadline.

Yancey, Jody   14:58
OK, OK.

Meyer, Matt   15:00
If you can't get it to us by this, it's a go into the next month or something like that.

Yancey, Jody   15:01
Because we're changing it to a bot, OK.

Presley, Rob   15:03
Yeah.

Yancey, Jody   15:05
OK.
OK.

Presley, Rob   15:06
Yeah.

Yancey, Jody   15:06
OK.

Presley, Rob   15:06
Love that.

Yancey, Jody   15:06
OK, because they've done that in the past.

Presley, Rob   15:07
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm.
I'm not.

Yancey, Jody   15:10
They they've come to me and said, can we please have more time?
And I'm like call OK if you get more time, I get more time to, like.
No, we get the time.
You still have to turn it around and in two days, yeah.

Meyer, Matt   15:17
Yeah, we'll.
Yeah, we'll chat with Brad on that one.

Presley, Rob   15:21
And.
OK.
I mean, just to, you know, dumb example when we could, we could have to be the 20th, that's 20th of every month or or the business day prior to the 20th.
I mean, we can.
There's different ways for us to skin this cat with sorry.

Yancey, Jody   15:33
OK, OK.

Presley, Rob   15:35
About the cat thing here, and with your neighbor but.

Yancey, Jody   15:37
Kissing. Kissing.

Presley, Rob   15:38
Do certain but different ways for us to handle it mean, but scheduling it out is is the route that we would want to go just to make sure that we can back out the turn around time.

Yancey, Jody   15:45
OK.

Presley, Rob   15:52
OK.
So.
So Vikram, I talked for a while.
I apologize, you still have a.
What's your question?

Anand, Vikram   16:00
Not a problem, Rob.
Jody, I just want to understand that this entire activity is that.
So what I understood, there are two ways to complete the task.
So one is the manual direct user interface and the other is the CAFR that you run.
Am I right?
I just want to understand that part.

Yancey, Jody   16:20
Exactly.
Yeah, exactly.
And we normally would not do the manual process because there's 3000.
Think the last file was 3600 plans, but you definitely could do a manual process if you had to.

Anand, Vikram   16:28
Yeah, I understand.

Yancey, Jody   16:34
That's kind of been our fall back for many years, is if we have to, we can do this manually.
We don't want to cause it'll take us, you know, a long time, but yes, you can run a capper or you can insert these manually.

Presley, Rob   16:45
Yeah.

Yancey, Jody   16:45
It does not matter, so it's not reliant on CAFR for these to be run, but CAFR just collects it and does it all in one.

Anand, Vikram   16:48
OK.
So if we have to compare it with the the American funds, so it would be the direct running it on easy the the screen by screen that we do that would be the one that will match what the American funds was.

Yancey, Jody   17:02
Yep.

Presley, Rob   17:03
Yeah.

Anand, Vikram   17:05
So the reason what Rob was also mentioning.

Yancey, Jody   17:05
Yep, Yep, Yep.

Presley, Rob   17:08
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly, Vikram.
And I think one of the things that that that we've talked about on on separate conversations, I don't think you were part of them is the the, the CAFR process, the the entitlements, uh or the access level for whatever reason, they're unable to figure out anybody else to extend those entitlements too.
I'm.
I'm saying this poorly, but Jody is the only one who can run it.
And yeah, so we would, we would, we would not replicate the CAFR process, we would we would, we would go very similarly to what was established for American funds and navigate the easy screens and and do the input that way.

Yancey, Jody   17:33
Yeah.

Presley, Rob   17:46
So we can we can get away from CAFR and and not run into those issues.

Anand, Vikram   17:54
No Rob, but that, that, that's exactly what I was saying now.
They said if I'm not wrong, if I hope I'm right here because I don't want to be saying something which is not supposed to be so the CAFR, does it actually work as the automation here?

Presley, Rob   18:11
It it?

Anand, Vikram   18:11
As a solution.

Presley, Rob   18:12
No, it's it it.
I think it'd be more problematic for us to figure out how to get Jodie entitlements.
It sounds like business has gone back and forth with different teams to try to get the access for other users and and they've been unsuccessful.

Anand, Vikram   18:24
Simply get OK.

Presley, Rob   18:27
Yeah, so.

Yancey, Jody   18:28
Yeah, they they thought they fixed it years ago.
They someone said Ohh it's because it puts your name on this file and then the next time it tries to run it.
If it's someone else's trying to do it still has your name, so they deleted that or something, and then it still did the same thing.

Presley, Rob   18:40
No.

Yancey, Jody   18:43
So yeah, that's been spinning wheels trying to figure out why, and then you know, everything else happens.

Presley, Rob   18:44
Gotcha.

Yancey, Jody   18:51
It was like, well, never mind.
We don't have time to look at this.
Jody can run it.
We've got a process.
We'll just let him continue to do this right, because we don't have the manpower fuel right now to look at something that we get four times a year and Jody can run it.

Presley, Rob   18:59
Umm.

Yancey, Jody   19:07
It's not.

Presley, Rob   19:07
Yep, understand.

Yancey, Jody   19:07
It's not broken if you will.
Yeah, but think about the point Dan is like we need other people to be able to run this in case Jody something happens.
If he's gone or something happens, this is going to be horrible when need to plan for this.

Anand, Vikram   19:23
I understood Jody.

Yancey, Jody   19:23
And I think, OK, I think that's the way you're going, right, Matt?

Anand, Vikram   19:24
Thank you.

Yancey, Jody   19:26
We wanna get away.
Work.
We wanna forget ****** and just produce a spreadsheet and have the bot do it, yeah.

Presley, Rob   19:30
Umm.

Meyer, Matt   19:33
Yeah. Yep.

Presley, Rob   19:33
Yep.
So I I think in terms of next steps just kind of glance now that the at the at the time too I think in terms of next steps we we we need the.

Yancey, Jody   19:42
Do that walk through like we did for America funds, yeah.

Presley, Rob   19:44
Yeah.
And unfortunately from from for for secops we need a you know like like a soft copy of the steps associated with it.

Yancey, Jody   19:54
Yep, I remember.

Presley, Rob   19:54
So you remember?

Yancey, Jody   19:55
I remember that.
Yep, no, no.

Presley, Rob   19:57
Yeah.
Yep.
So I I think that that's that would be that would be the first step and then the more complicated piece is is figuring out when to schedule this build and to be candid, it's going to be toward the tail end of a year.
Here umm, if if things line up well for us, I I feel like some of the code that's already in place for the American funds.
If there's, if there's replication across the screens, we've got some experience with that, but I don't remember who built this originally.
I wanna say it was Jyothiswar.
I can't recall, but I would.
I would look to have somebody like new to the team build this one.
If we can by the tail end of the year, so.
Unless business.

Meyer, Matt   20:42
OK, I think that works.

Presley, Rob   20:43
Unless business.
Yeah.
I mean, unless I mean that I and and I say this, I have to put a caveat.
I I'm I'm sorry, but like.
We and I see Harrison's on the call, so he's probably smiling.
You know where I'm gonna go this already?
Like we are continually surprised with new requests and high dollar value pieces that we have are forced to prioritize.
So this is it's kind of a moving target, to be candid.

Meyer, Matt   21:04
Yep, Yep.

Presley, Rob   21:04
I think I think, yeah, let's get it all keyed up, and if it's shovel ready, then we're in a great place to to be able to handle it when the capacity becomes available.

Yancey, Jody   21:14
Ohh Rob, you know what?

Meyer, Matt   21:15
OK.

Yancey, Jody   21:15
I you know what I said up front?
You heard my spiel about this.

Presley, Rob   21:19
Yep.
Cool, I don't.

Yancey, Jody   21:23
Alright, I'll get those.
I'll start working on those for sheet.
I'll see if I still have the American funds bought 1.

Presley, Rob   21:30
Yeah.

Yancey, Jody   21:30
There's surprising this is American funds as well.
So it's, I mean, that's why we're thinking we can use the same thing, but I'll see if I still have those sheets and kind of.
Still get that going and then reach out to you guys and say, hey, I think I think I'm ready.
Let's set up a call.
Does that?
Does that work OK?

Presley, Rob   21:44
Yeah, that'd be great.
Think that.
Cool.
And I might have to documentation for if you're click path too, I'll look for it and at the same time you do.

Meyer, Matt   21:49
Cool.

Yancey, Jody   21:55
Alright.
Well, I'll get ahold of you guys don't know when, but shortly, you know, to sooner rather than later.
