Hi Karthik,

Yes, I connected with Jyothi before submitting the bot creation request. He told me some steps to follow, which I did. I also mentioned the easy application screen codes, but I think I need to attach the screenshot with the ticket. Sorry, I forgot to attach it. This won't happen again. I'll connect with Jyothi again and attach the requirement document to the ticket.




As I informed you yesterday, the RPA code is ready for production with the new changes. I am just waiting for your feedback. Please let me know when we can deploy the new RPA code into production.



Thank you, Rob. Yes, I received the recording. I will go through the recording to understand the flow



I have already discussed this with Cheryl, and she told me she will check the updates with the EBSI team first. Then, she can set the deployment date for the RPA."
