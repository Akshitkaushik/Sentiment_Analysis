Hello Khan,

Today, I triggered the bot with the same data, and it ran successfully as expected. I hope the input email participants have also received the communication email. Could you please confirm if the business team has received the audit file as well?

Additionally, could you validate the COMMAC number in the Easy application to ensure that the bot is selecting the correct command on your end? Your confirmation on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
