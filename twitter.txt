As an RPA Automation Anywhere Developer, I am eager to further enhance my skills in automation technologies. Having joined the organization two months ago, my current focus is on solidifying my expertise in Automation Anywhere while also exploring other RPA tools like Power Automate Desktop and UiPath. Additionally, as my team manages Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), I am keen to learn cloud platforms such as AWS, which will help me better support VDI and contribute to scalable automation solutions. I am committed to continuous learning and aligning my growth with the evolving needs of the organization.

In addition to deepening my technical expertise, I am also interested in expanding my responsibilities by taking on more complex projects, mentoring new team members, and contributing to the strategic direction of automation initiatives within the company. I am committed to continuous learning and career growth, with a long-term goal of progressing into leadership roles, where I can drive innovation and transformation.


Support Required for Career Development:

Training: I'd benefit from access to training for Automation Anywhere, other RPA tools like UiPath, and cloud platforms like AWS. I’m happy to take on the responsibility of completing these, but I would appreciate support and guidance from the organization in accessing these resources.

Mentorship: It would be helpful to get guidance from senior developers with experience in cloud computing and VDI. I’ll take the initiative to schedule meetings, but I’d appreciate support in connecting with the right people.

Project Involvement: Getting involved in projects related to VDI and AWS would give me practical experience. I’ll actively look for these opportunities, and it would be great if leadership could consider me for relevant tasks.

With these supports, I’m confident I can grow my skills and contribute more to the team.
