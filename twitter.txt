How to Fill Out the Form:
Name – Owner’s Name: Karthik

Owner’s Contact: Enter Karthik’s email.
After entering these details, click on the "Add Owner Contact" button.
Then, click on the "Create" button.
Once created, you will receive your Dev and QA client credentials, which can be used to generate the token in your API.
Note:
When creating Dev and QA client credentials, you may encounter access issues on the client credentials page. If you do not have access, you need to raise a database access request.
