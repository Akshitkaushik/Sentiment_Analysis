Assistance Required for the Iowa Process in Khan's Absence

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am reaching out regarding the state of Iowa process. As you are aware, Khan is currently on leave. In his absence, I would appreciate your guidance on whom I should connect with to gain a better understanding of the process.

Your prompt assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support.
