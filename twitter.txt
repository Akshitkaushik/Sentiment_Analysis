Hello Tom,

Thank you very much for providing the Service Update API endpoints.

I have a query regarding this process. I believe we may need an additional API endpoint for JWT Authorization to successfully utilize the shared API endpoints. Could you please share the JWT generator endpoint as well? Alternatively, if you are using a different approach, I would appreciate it if you could guide me accordingly.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
