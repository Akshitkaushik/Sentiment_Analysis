ubject: Request for Assistance in Setting Up Machine for Production

Dear Sanjay,

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that the process development and UAT for the State of Iowa have been successfully completed. Could you kindly assist with setting up a machine for the production environment? The bot ID for the State of Iowa is SAAP183, and the application user is Easy.

Please let me know if you require any further information or assistance from my side.

Thank you in advance for your support.
