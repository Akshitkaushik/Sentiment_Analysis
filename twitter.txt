Subject: Summary of Changes to HDQ Bot Tasks

Dear [Recipient's Name],

As discussed during our code review call, I have implemented the following changes to the HDQ bot tasks:

HDQ Master: No changes made, except for the removal of the DLL and legacy commands.
HDQ Folder: Removed the legacy variable section.
HDQ_SENDEmail: Eliminated the DLL Outlook command and added the AA360 Outlook action.
HDQ_Read_SendEmail: Disabled the Cirrus part and replaced the DLL Outlook command with AA360 Outlook.
Additionally, I have updated the current email template with the new version provided by the business.
