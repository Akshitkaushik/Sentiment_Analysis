I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss something personal with you. I noticed on Workday that there are developer openings in our team, and I wanted to ask if it would be possible to refer someone for the position.

I have a family connection who is currently looking for a job. He has around 12 years of experience in the IT industry, with approximately 10 years in RPA development and support. At present, he is managing a support team, similar to how Mahesh is managing in our team. He is proficient in two tools—Blue Prism and Automation Anywhere—and has experience working in the healthcare and insurance domains.

If you're okay with it and the opening is still available, may I refer him? Please let me know your thoughts.
