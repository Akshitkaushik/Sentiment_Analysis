Dear Rob,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that the termination-dated enhancement part has been completed, and Cheryl is satisfied with the results.

Additionally, I would like to bring to your attention the "Termination Date Branding Bot." This bot has not been triggered so far. Could you kindly confirm if we can proceed to decommission this bot?
