Dear Cheryl,

Thank you for your response.

As per your request, I have made the changes mentioned in your email. Specifically, I have updated the fonts and adjusted the screenshot sizes as highlighted in point no. 1 of your email. I have shared the updated results with you via email for your review.

Thank you for confirming the closure regarding the second point in your email.

For confirmation, I would like to clarify that we are using two bots: one for "termination dated" and the other for "termination branding." Could you please confirm if I can proceed with applying the same changes to the "termination branding" bot template? I have currently shared the updated results for the "termination dated" bot. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Regarding the "Gov as result email" part, I will review it and provide you with updates as soon as possible.

Please let me know your feedback on the shared results at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
