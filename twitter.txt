No, I did not share the audit file with Cheryl during the testing phase because we were using our group email ID. I only shared the email template with Cheryl, and all the other code is working fine. I shared the test results with you only. Now, almost all the columns are the same in the input file, and Cheryl is asking why we changed the audit log format. Could you please reply to that email since you have a good understanding of why we made these changes?
