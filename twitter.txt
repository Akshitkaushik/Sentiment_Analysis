Hi Khan, hope you're doing well.

I wanted to update you that weâ€™ve created the Client API ID and Client Secret for token generation for the MTR process. However, the JWT endpoints are still not confirmed.

I understand thereâ€™s a call scheduled with TOM to discuss this, but I was hoping to verify the credentials with the endpoints beforehand to check if they are working as expected. This way, if there are any issues, I can raise them with the OAuth team in advance.

Could you please help by asking TOM if he can use these credentials on his end to test their functionality? If he agrees, I can share the credentials with him directly so he can provide feedback. I already sent him a message on Teams, but I believe he might be busy with other tasks right now.

Your help with this would save us time and ensure everything is ready for future development. Please let me know if this works.

Thank you! ðŸ˜Š
