Assistance Required: SSN Data Access Issue in Production Environment

Dear Tony,

I hope this message finds you well.

Today, I commenced testing in the production environment utilizing the production database. However, I am encountering an issue accessing SSN data specifically in this environment. I have attached a screenshot of the error for your reference.

In the UAT environment, I can access the SSN data without any issues, suggesting the problem is isolated to the production setup. I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the matter and provide any necessary assistance to resolve it.

Thank you very much for your support and attention to this matter.
