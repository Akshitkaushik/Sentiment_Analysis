Your enrollment may require one final step. If you have not already done so, you must initiate your 
payroll contributions.

(https://das.iowa.gov/state-employees/human-resources/employees/ric-stateemployees/457-payroll-deductions) to elect your paycheck contribution amount.
• Public Sector Employees (e.g. public hospital, city) - please complete your employer’s RIC
